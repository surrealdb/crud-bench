# crud-bench

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is an open-source benchmarking tool for testing and comparing the performance of a
number of different workloads on embedded, networked, and remote databases. It can be used to compare both SQL and NoSQL
platforms including key-value, embedded, relational, document, and multi-model databases. Importantly crud-bench focuses
on testing additional features which are not present in other benchmarking tools, but which are available in SurrealDB.

The primary purpose of crud-bench is to continually test and monitor the performance of features and functionality built
in to SurrealDB, enabling developers working on features in SurrealDB to assess the impact of their changes on database
queries and performance.

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is being actively developed with new features and functionality being added regularly.

## Contributing

The crud-bench benchmarking tool is open-source, and we encourage additions, modifications, and improvements to the
benchmark runtime, and the datastore implementations.

## How does it work?

When running simple, automated tests, the crud-bench benchmarking tool will automatically start a Docker container for
the datastore or database which is being benchmarked (when the datastore or database is networked). This configuration
can be modified so that an optimised, remote environment can be connected to, instead of running a Docker container
locally. This allows for running crud-bench against remote datastores, and distributed datastores on a local network
or remotely in the cloud.

In one table, the benchmark will operate 4 main tasks:

- Create: inserting N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Read: read N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Update: update N unique records, with the specified concurrency.
- Scans: perform a number of range and table scans, with the specified concurrency.
- Delete: delete N unique records, with the specified concurrency.

With crud-bench almost all aspects of the benchmark engine are configurable:

- The number of rows or records (samples).
- The number of concurrent clients or connections.
- The number of concurrent threads (concurrent messages per client).
- Whether rows or records are modified sequentially or randomly.
- The primary id or key type for the records.
- The row or record content including support for nested objects and arrays.
- The scan specifications for range or table queries.

## Benchmarks

### Value

You can use the argument `-v` or `--value` (or the environment variable `CRUD_BENCH_VALUE`) to customize the row,
document, or record value which should be used in the benchmark tests. Pass a JSON structure that will serve as a
template for generating a randomized value.

> [!NOTE]
> For tabular, or column-oriented databases (e.g. Postgres, MySQL, ScyllaDB), the first-level fields of the JSON
> structure are translated as columns, and any nested structures will be stored in a JSON column where possible.

Within the JSON structure, the following values are replaced by randomly generated data:

- Every occurrence of `string:XX` will be replaced by a random string with XX characters.
- Every occurrence of `text:XX` will be replaced by a random string made of words of 2 to 10 characters, for a total of
  XX characters.
- Every occurrence of `string:X..Y` will be replaced by a random string between X and Y characters.
- Every occurrence of `text:X..Y` will be replaced by a random string made of words of 2 to 10 characters, for a total
  between X and Y characters.
- Every `int` will be replaced by a random integer (i32).
- Every `int:X..Y` will be replaced by a random integer (i32) between X and Y.
- Every `float` will be replaced by a random float (f32).
- Every `float:X..Y` will be replaced by a random float (f32) between X and Y.
- Every `uuid` will be replaced by a random UUID (v4).
- Every `bool` will be replaced by a `true` or `false` (v4).
- Every `string_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a string from `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `int_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a i32 from  `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `float_enum:A,B,C` will be replaced by a f32 from  `A` `B` or `C`.
- Every `datetime` will be replaced by a datetime (ISO 8601).

```json
{
  "text": "text:30",
  "text_range": "text:10..50",
  "bool": "bool",
  "string_enum": "enum:foo,bar",
  "datetime": "datetime",
  "float": "float",
  "float_range": "float:1..10",
  "float_enum": "float:1.1,2.2,3.3",
  "integer": "int",
  "integer_range": "int:1..5",
  "integer_enum": "int:1,2,3",
  "uuid": "uuid",
  "nested": {
    "text": "text:100",
    "array": [
      "string:10",
      "string:2..5"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Scans

You can use the argument `-a` or `--scans` (or the environment variable `CRUD_BENCH_SCANS`) to customise the range,
table, or scan queries that are performed in the benchmark. This parameter accepts a JSON array, where each item
represents a different scan test. Each test is defined as a JSON object specifying the scan parameters and the test
name.

> [!NOTE]
> Not every database benchmark adapter supports scans or range queries. In such cases, the benchmark will not fail but
> the associated tests will indicate that the benchmark was `skipped`.

Each scan object can make use of the following values:

- `name`: A descriptive name for the test.
- `projection`: The projection type of the scan:
    - `"ID"`: only the ID is returned.
    - `"FULL"`: the whole record is returned.
    - `"COUNT"`: count the number of records.
- `start`: Skips the specified number of rows before starting to return rows.
- `limit`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.
- `expect`: (optional) Asserts the expected number of rows returned.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "limit100",
    "projection": "FULL",
    "start": 0,
    "limit": 100,
    "expect": 100
  },
  {
    "name": "start100",
    "projection": "ID",
    "start": 100,
    "limit": 100,
    "expect": 100
  }
]
```
